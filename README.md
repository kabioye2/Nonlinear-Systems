Introduction
The brain needs nutrients and needs to get rid of waste on a continuous basis. The blood control
both transports. Water is an important nutrient that is handled by the blood brain barrier (BBB).
This assignment describes the transport of solute and water and how it moves across a membrane
with no linear equations. Eigenvectors can be used to solve these equations to study solute
transport across the BBB.

Conclusion
Convection and concentration equations were used to find the concentration profile in a
membrane. A contour and surface map were produced to visualize the error between two
membranes.

Discussion
Eigenvectors are useful when solving for non-linear equations which usually describe biological
systems. This assignment was effective in learning how to use this knowledge to study solute
across membranes.
